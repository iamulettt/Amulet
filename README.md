We can see the server display in the background, with the Android client and a finger on the right side.

After enabling the registration mode, two fingers are registered, with  each finger being pressed three times. This parameter is also used to  distinguish which finger it is. Once the registration mode is closed,  the first finger successfully passed verification after being pressed  six times, and the second finger also successfully passed verification  after being pressed six times. Fingers that were not registered did not  pass verification.
